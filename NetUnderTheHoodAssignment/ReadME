In this assignment a CSV file is loaded. This CSV file contains 4000 rows and 432 columns. The values of this table may be empty, bool, strings, ints and decimals. 
The aim of this assignment is to improve the performance of the Code on terms of memory usage, time taken to writing and reading the data in the memory.
In the /OldSolution all data would be stored in the memory. Considering that the file had a lot of empty cells we have setted the program to store only not null values.
In addition, all the data were stored with type: object in the first solution, so when we noticed that there are only 4 types of data(bool, string, int & decimal), we changed the code to store them in different Lists, each one on it's specific type. 
This helped to prevent unnecessary boxing/unboxing of the data, while acessing them.
